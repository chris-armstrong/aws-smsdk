A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you use [StartReplay] and specify an [EventStartTime] and an [EventEndTime] that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use [DescribeReplay] to determine the progress of a replay.

    Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_DisableRule.html}DisableRule}.
    
     A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventBus.html}CreateEventBus}.
     
      If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this [PutRule] command. If you omit arguments in [PutRule], the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values.
      
       When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
       
        A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.
        
         When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the [PutRule] operation and assign tags, you must have both the [events:PutRule] and [events:TagResource] permissions.
         
          If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the [PutRule] operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html}TagResource} and {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html}UntagResource}.
          
           Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
           
            In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
            
             To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
             
              An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html}Managing Your Costs with Budgets}.

      The maximum number of entries per request is 10.
      
       Each rule can have up to five (5) targets associated with it at one time.
       
        For a list of services you can configure as targets for events, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html}EventBridge targets} in the {i {i Amazon EventBridge User Guide}}.
        
         Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. The built-in targets are:
         
          {ul
               {- [Amazon EBS CreateSnapshot API call]
                  
                  }
                {- [Amazon EC2 RebootInstances API call]
                   
                   }
                {- [Amazon EC2 StopInstances API call]
                   
                   }
                {- [Amazon EC2 TerminateInstances API call]
                   
                   }
               
      }
       For some target types, [PutTargets] provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the [KinesisParameters] argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the [RunCommandParameters] field.
       
        To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions:
        
         {ul
              {- For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies.
                 
                 }
               {- For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, Step Functions state machines and API Gateway APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the [RoleARN] argument in [PutTargets].
                  
                  }
              
      }
       For more information, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html}Authentication and Access Control} in the {i {i Amazon EventBridge User Guide}}.
       
        If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using [PutPermission]), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the [Arn] value when you run [PutTargets]. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see {{:http://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/}Amazon EventBridge Pricing}.
        
         [Input], [InputPath], and [InputTransformer] are not available with [PutTarget] if the target is an event bus of a different Amazon Web Services account.
         
          If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a [RoleArn] with proper permissions in the [Target] structure. For more information, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html}Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts} in the {i Amazon EventBridge User Guide}.
          
           If you have an IAM role on a cross-account event bus target, a [PutTargets] call without a role on the same target (same [Id] and [Arn]) will not remove the role.
           
            For more information about enabling cross-account events, see {{:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutPermission.html}PutPermission}.
            
             {b Input}, {b InputPath}, and {b InputTransformer} are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:
             
              {ul
                   {- If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).
                      
                      }
                    {- If {b Input} is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.
                       
                       }
                    {- If {b InputPath} is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, [$.detail]), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).
                       
                       }
                    {- If {b InputTransformer} is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
                       
                       }
                   
      }
       When you specify [InputPath] or [InputTransformer], you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.
       
        When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
        
         This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, [FailedEntryCount] is non-zero in the response and each entry in [FailedEntries] provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.
